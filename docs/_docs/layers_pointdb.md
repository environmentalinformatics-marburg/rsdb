title: PointDB layer (point cloud data)
---

**Points** in a point cloud have **x,y,z** coordinates and associated **properties**.   
Properties are limited to LiDAR specific, use [PointCloud](../layers_pointcloud) layer for more flexibility.

From point cloud points structural indices can be calculated. Details to **point cloud indices** are located in the [RSDB wiki](https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/rsdb/wiki/Point-cloud-indices).

!! **PointDB is an obsolete layer type. Use [PointCloud](../layers_pointcloud) layer for new data.** !!
